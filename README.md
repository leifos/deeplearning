# Deep Learning

In this repository, I've coded up a series of examples from "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow" by Aurélien Geron.

While Aurélien provides a series of notebooks: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2 here I have put together a series examples written in Python to show how these can be put together and run from the command line.

## From Chapter 9 on TensorFlow

*ch9_simple_graph.py*: shows the basic mechanics of the TensorFlow framework

*ch9_linear_regression.py*: shows how TensorFlow can be configured to perform linear regression

*ch9_gradient_descent.py*: shows how you can train the network using the full set of data

*ch9_mini_batch_gradient_descent.py*: shows how you can train the network using mini-batches
